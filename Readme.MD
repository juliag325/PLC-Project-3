# PROJECT 3
Sindy Wu and Julia Aiello 

**How to Run Our Code**
Make sure cabal is installed and updated. 

*cabal build*

To Run Tests: 
    1. Pascal test cases: 
        *cabal run tests/test4.pas*
        (Replace test4.pas with any test needed)
    2. Hspec unit tests: 
        *runhaskell InterpretSpec.hs* or 
        *runhaskell ValSpec.hs*
        etc. 

Implemented: 

All aspects from Project 1 and 2 were reimplemented into Project 3, using Haskell. 
Parameters were also included (which received extra credit on the last project)

*Pascal test cases are run to analyze the more complex Pascal programs*
*The Hspec unit test cases analyze the implementation of the interpreter and parser*
